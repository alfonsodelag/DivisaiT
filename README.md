# DivisionIT - Technical Test

React Node Template is a simple, unopinionated, full stack web app template, with the goal of facilitating quick prototyping and deployment to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or elsewhere.

This template combines a **client** generated by `create-react-app` and a **server** 

In local dev, the React dev server & Node server are run side by side, with API calls [proxied](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/) through the React dev server to the Node server. In production, the Node app will serve both the static React production build and the API.

### Project Structure

- `src/client` contains the [React](https://reactjs.org/) app
- `src/server` contains the [Node](https://nodejs.org/) [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) app
- `package.json` in the project root contains scripts to run in dev mode locally, and also to build and run on Heroku

### Local Dev Setup

All commands run from project root:

1. `cd src/client && npm install`
2. `cd src/server && npm install`
3. Make sure `nodemon` & `concurrently` are installed globally
4. `npm run dev`

You will now see the output of both the React dev server and the Node server in your shell, running at the same time thanks to `concurrently`. 

Hope you've enjoyed the project!
